INSTALLING

To install the library you need to do the
following:

  1. Set the CXXFLAGS environment variable to
  your preferred settings, for example:
    export CXXFLAGS="-O2"
    export CXXFLAGS="-Wall -g"
  The default flags are "-O2 -DNDEBUG". 

  2. Run:
    ./configure

  You can use --enable-debug to compile a debug library.

  By default include files and library files
  will be installed in /usr/local. If you would
  like to use a different installation directory
  (e.g., in case that you do not have root access)
  run the configure script with the --prefix option:
    ./configure --prefix=/home/marioh/usr

  5. Make the library:
    make

  6. Install the library:
    make install
