INSTALLING

To install the library you need to do the
following:

  1. Install the Tools library (download from
  http://cs-people.bu.edu/marioh/tools).

  2. If the Tools library is not installed in
  the default path, then use the LDFLAGS and
  CPPFLAGS environment variables to direct
  the configure script to the right path, e.g.:
    export LDFLAGS="-L/home/marioh/usr/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/marioh/usr/include"

  3. Set the CXXFLAGS environment variable to
  your preferred settings, for example:
    export CXXFLAGS="-O2"
    export CXXFLAGS="-Wall -g"
  The default flags are "-g -O2" or "-g", depending
  on your system.

  4. Run:
    ./configure
  By default include files and library files
  will be installed in /usr/local. If you would
  like to use a different installation directory
  (e.g., in case that you do not have root access)
  run the configure script with the --prefix option:
    ./configure --prefix=/home/marioh/usr

  5. Make the library:
    make

  6. Install the library:
    make install
